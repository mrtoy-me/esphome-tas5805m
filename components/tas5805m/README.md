# ESPHome component for ESP32-S3 Louder and ESP32 Louder
The ESP32-S3 Louder and ESP32 Louder uses a TAS5805M DAC. This ESPHome external component
is based on the following ESP32 Platform TAS5805M DAC driver:
https://github.com/sonocotta/esp32-tas5805m-dac/tree/main by Andriy Malyshenko
which is licenced under GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE Version 3, 29 June 2007.
Information from this repository has also been used/reproduced in this read.me to provide
a better understanding of how to use this component to generate firmware using Esphome Builder.

# Usage: Tas5805m component on Github
This component requires Esphome version 2025.7.0 or later.

The following yaml can be used so ESPHome accesses the component files:
```
external_components:
  - source: github://mrtoy-me/esphome-tas5805m@main
    components: [ tas5805m ]

# Overview
This component is specifically intended for use with ESP32-S3 Louder or ESP32 Louder
which both have a TAS5805M DAC for producing audio.
This component uses the Esphome ESP_IDF framwork and must be configured accordingly.
While this component works with both versions of the "Louder", the ESP32-S3 Louder
has larger PSRAM and hence has better performance than the ESP32 Louder.

The component allows many features of the TAS5808M DAC to be configured
prior to firmware generation or configured/controlled through Homeassistant.
Fault sensors can also be configured, so their status is visible in Homeassistant.

The component YAML configuration uses the esphome Audio DAC Core component,
and is configured under **audio_dac:** as **- platform: tas5805m**

The TAS5805M DAC is controlled by I2C so the component requires configuration of
**i2c:** with **sda:** and **scl:** pins.

Appropriate configuration of psram, i2s_audio, speaker and mediaplayer are required.
Example YAML configurations are provided and are listed at the end of this document.

## Component Features
The component communicates with ESP32 Louder's TAS5805M and provides the following features:
- initialise TAS5805M DAC
- enable/disable TAS5805M DAC
- adjust TAS5805M maximum and minimum volume level
- set DAC mode
- set Mixer mode
- set EQ Control state and EQ gains
- get fault states
- automatically clear fault states
- set Analog Gain
- set Volume
- set Mute state

YAML configuration includes:
- two optional tas5805m platform Switch configurations - Enable Louder and Enable EQ Control
- 15 optional EQ Gain tas5805m platform Numbers (all required or none configured) to control EQ gains
- 12 optional tas5805m platform Binary Sensors corresonding to TAS5805M fault codes (all optional)
- an optional tas5805m platform Sensor providing the number of times a fault was detected and fault cleared

# Louder TAS5805M Features
## Analog Gain and Digital Volume
The analog gain setting ensures that the output signal is not clipped at different supply voltage levels.
With TAS5805M analog gain set at the appropriate level, the TAS5805M digital volume
is used to set the audio volume. Keep in mind, it is perfectly safe to set the
analog gain at a lower level.
Note: that the component allows defining analog gain in YAML and cannot be altered at runtime.

## DAC Mode
TAS5805M has a bridge mode of operation, that causes both output drivers to synchronize
and push out the same audio with double the power. Typical setup for each of the
Dac Modes is shown in the following table.
Note: the component allows defining Dac Mode in YAML and cannot be altered at runtime.

|   | BTL (default, STEREO) | PBTL (MONO, rougly double power) |
|---|-----------------------|---------------------------|
| Descriotion | Bridge Tied Load, Stereo | Parallel Bridge Tied Load, Mono |
| Rated Power | 2×23W (8-Ω, 21 V, THD+N=1%) | 45W (4-Ω, 21 V, THD+N=1%) |

## Mixer Mode
Mixer mode allows mixing of channel signals and route them to the appropriate audio
channel. The typical setup for the mixer is to send Left channel audio to the Left driver,
and Right channel to the Right. A common alternative is to combine both channels into
true Mono (you need to reduce both to -3Db to compensate for signal doubling).
In BTL Dac Mode, the mixer mode can be set to STEREO, INVERSE_STEREO, MONO, LEFT or RIGHT while
in PBTL Dac Mode, the mixer mode can be set to MONO, LEFT or RIGHT.


## EQ Band Gains
TAS5805M has a powerful 15-channel EQ that allows defining each channel's transfer function
using BQ coefficients. For practical purposes, the audio range is split into 15 bands,
defining for each a -15 to +15 dB gain adjustment range and appropriate bandwidth to
cause mild overlap. This keeps the curve flat enough to not cause distortions
even in extreme settings, but also allows a wide range of transfer characteristics.

| Band | Center Frequency (Hz) | Frequency Range (Hz) | Q-Factor (Approx.) |
|------|-----------------------|----------------------|--------------------|
| 1    | 20                    | 10–30                | 2                  |
| 2    | 31.5                  | 20–45                | 2                  |
| 3    | 50                    | 35–70                | 1.5                |
| 4    | 80                    | 55–110               | 1.5                |
| 5    | 125                   | 85–175               | 1                  |
| 6    | 200                   | 140–280              | 1                  |
| 7    | 315                   | 220–440              | 0.9                |
| 8    | 500                   | 350–700              | 0.9                |
| 9    | 800                   | 560–1120             | 0.8                |
| 10   | 1250                  | 875–1750             | 0.8                |
| 11   | 2000                  | 1400–2800            | 0.7                |
| 12   | 3150                  | 2200–4400            | 0.7                |
| 13   | 5000                  | 3500–7000            | 0.6                |
| 14   | 8000                  | 5600–11200           | 0.6                |


## Fault States
TAS5805M has a fault detection system that allows it to self-diagnose issues with
power, data signal, short circuits, overheating etc. The general pattern for
fault detection is periodic check of fault registers, and when there are any
faults, provide notification through sensor/s and clear any fault afterwards.


# Activation of Mixer mode and EQ Gains
For software configuration of the Mixer and EQ Gains, the Louder's TAS5805M
must have received a stable I2S signal. If a Mixer setting (other than default)
and/or EQ Band Gain Numbers are configured, what this means for this component
is that before the component writes these settings to the TAS5805M,
the TAS5805M must have received some audio.

## Typical Use Case - Speaker Mediaplayer
The typical way of handling this requirement is where speaker mediaplayer component
is configured to play audio during boot. In this case, a short sound file is
configured under **mediaplayer:** and configuration added under **esphome:**
to play that short sound at the correct point in the boot process.

Configuration required to be included under **mediaplayer:** YAML is:
```
files:
    id: startup_sync_sound
    file: https://github.com/mrtoy-me/esphome-tas5805m/raw/main/components/tas5805m/boot_louder.flac
```
Configuration required to be included under **esphome:** YAML:
```
on_boot:
    priority: 220.0
    then:
      media_player.speaker.play_on_device_media_file: startup_sync_sound
```
The **audio_dac:** has an optional configuration variable called **refresh_eq:**
The default configuration of **refresh_eq: BY_GAIN** matches the above use case and
therefore is not required(can be omitted) from the **audio_dac:** YAML configuration.

## Use Case where Speaker Mediaplayer is not used (eg using a SnapCast client component)
Another use case, is use of Snapcast client component instead of Speaker Mediaplayer component
to produce the required audio. In this use case, the following "workaround" is necessary
to play audio through the Louder's TAS58065M before the component writes the Mixer and
EQ Gain settings to the TAS5805M. This workaround requires the user to start playing audio
then turn on the Enable EQ Switch. The following changed configuration is required:

1) Configure **audio_dac:** with optional configuration variable and value **refresh_eq: BY_SWITCH**
2) Configure **switch: - platform: tas5805m** with **enable_eq:** as follows:
```
switch:
  - platform: tas5805m
    enable_eq:
      name: Enable EQ Control
      restore_mode: ALWAYS_OFF
```

3) After Louder has booted, manually initiate playing of some audio
4) Turn Enable EQ Switch On


# YAML configuration

## Audio Dac

Example typical configuration:
```
audio_dac:
  - platform: tas5805m
    id: tas5805_dac
    enable_pin: GPIOxx
    analog_gain: -9db
    dac_mode: BTL
    mixer_mode: STEREO
    volume_max: 0dB
    volume_min: -60db
    update_interval: 4s
```
Configuration variables:
- **enable_pin:** (*Required*): GPIOxx, enable pin of ESP32 Louder

- **analog_gain:** (*Optional*): dB values from -15.5dB to 0dB in 0.5dB increments
  Defaults to -15.5dbB. A setting of -15.5db is typical when
  5v is used to power the Louder

- **dac_mode:** (*Optional*): valid values BTL or PBTL. Defaults to BTL

- **mixer_mode:** (*Optional*): values STEREO, INVERSE_STEREO, MONO, LEFT or RIGHT
  Defaults to STEREO. Note: for PBTL Dac Mode, only MONO, LEFT or RIGHT are valid.

- **volume_max:** (*Optional*): whole dB values from -103dB to 24dB. Defaults to 24dB

- **volume_min:** (*Optional*): whole dB values from -103dB to 24dB. Defaults to -103dB

- **update_interval:** (*Optional*): defines the interval (seconds) at which faults will be
  checked and then if detected will be cleared at next interval. Defaults to 4s.
  For ESP32-S3 Louder, update interval can be reduced as low as 1s.

- **refresh_eq:** (*Optional*): valid values BY_GAIN or BY_SWITCH. Defaults to BY_GAIN
  This setting can normally be ignored and omitted if you are using Speaker
  Mediaplayer component and is intended for use when Snapcast client component
  is used instead of Speaker Mediaplayer. When a Snapcast client component is
  configured, the BY_SWITCH value should be used. See information under
  "Activation of Mixer mode and EQ Gains" section above and provided YAML examples.


## Switches
Two tas5805m platform switches can be configured to provide switches
in Homeassistant.
- Enable Louder Switch, more specifically places TAS5805M into Play mode or
  into low power Sleep mode
- Enable EQ Control Switch which switches the TAS5805M DAC EQ control On/Off.
  This switch works in conjunction with configuration of tas5805m
  platform numbers which configure gain of EQ Bands.

The example YAML also includes an **interval:** and **mediaplayer:** configuration to
trigger Enable Louder Switch Off when there is no music player activity (idle or paused)
for the defined time and when music player activity is detected (by mediaplayer),
the Enable Louder Switch is triggered On. The example interval configuration also
requires configuration of **mediaplayer:** which is also shown in the YAML examples.

Configuration of Tas5805m Switches in typical use case:

```switch:
  - platform: tas5805m
    enable_dac:
      name: Enable Louder
      id: enable_louder
      restore_mode: ALWAYS_ON
    enable_eq:
      name: Enable EQ Control
      restore_mode: RESTORE_DEFAULT_ON
```
Configuration headers:
- **enable_dac:** (*Optional*): allows the definition of a switch to enable/disable
  the TAS5805M DAC. Switch On (enabled) places TAS5805M into Play mode while
  Switch Off (disabled) places TAS5805M into low power Sleep mode.
    Configuration variables:
    - **restore_mode:** (optional but recommended): **ALWAYS_ON** is recommended.

- **enable_eq:** (*Optional*): allows the definition of a switch to turn on/off
  the TAS5805M DAC EQ Control Mode. Switch On enables TAS5805M EQ Control while
  Switch Off disables TAS5805M EQ Control.
    Configuration variables:
    - **restore_mode:** (optional but recommended): **RESTORE_DEFAULT_ON** is
      recommended for typical use case where speaker mediaplayer is use for audio.
      For use case, where SnapCast client component is used instead of
      Speaker mediaplayer component, **ALWAYS_OFF** is recommended.

## EQ Band Gain Numbers
15 EQ Band Gain Numbers can be configured for controlling the gain of each EQ Band
in Homeassistant. The number configuration heading for each number is shown below
with an example name configured. Defining **number: -platform: tas5805m** requires
all 15 EQ Gain Band headings to be configured. For TAS5805M EQ Band Gains to
configure correctly requires some addition YAML configuration, refer to the
"Activation of Mixer mode and EQ Gains" section above and provided YAML examples.

Example configuration of Tas5805m Band Gain Numbers:
```
number:
  - platform: tas5805m
      eq_gain_band20Hz:
        name: Gain ---20Hz
      eq_gain_band31.5Hz:
        name: Gain ---31.5Hz
      eq_gain_band50Hz:
        name: Gain ---50Hz
      eq_gain_band80Hz:
        name: Gain ---80Hz
      eq_gain_band125Hz:
        name: Gain --125Hz
      eq_gain_band200Hz:
        name: Gain --200Hz
      eq_gain_band315Hz:
        name: Gain --315Hz
      eq_gain_band500Hz:
        name: Gain --500Hz
      eq_gain_band800Hz:
        name: Gain --800Hz
      eq_gain_band1250Hz:
        name: Gain -1250Hz
      eq_gain_band2000Hz:
        name: Gain -2000Hz
      eq_gain_band3150Hz:
        name: Gain -3150Hz
      eq_gain_band5000Hz:
        name: Gain -5000Hz
      eq_gain_band8000Hz:
        name: Gain -8000Hz
      eq_gain_band16000Hz:
        name: Gain 16000Hz
```

## Announce Volume Template Number
The example YAML defines an Announce Volume template number which can be used in
conjuction with the **mediaplayer:** YAML configurations for adjusting the
announcement pipeline audio volume separately to the media pipeline volume.
This is useful for a Text-to-Speech announcements that may have a different
volume level to the audio playing through the media pipeline.
The YAML examples provide an example of how this can be configured.

## Binary Sensors
Binary sensors can be configured which correspond to fault codes from the TAS5805M.
The tas5805m binary sensor platform has configuration headings for each binary sensor
as shown below with an example name configured.
All 12 binary sensors can be optionally defined but it is recommended that at minimum,
one binary sensor **have_fault:** is configured. The **have_fault:** binary sensor
activates if any the TAS5805M faults conditions activate.

**have_fault** Configuration variable:
  - **exclude:** (optional): **CLOCK_FAULT** allows clock fault to be excluded from have_fault binary sensor.
    Default is not to exclude clock faults from the have_fault binary sensor.

**over_temp_warning:** Example Yaml configuration to reduce volume on over temperature warnng:
  To attempt to mitigate a over temperature warning, the volume can be decreased using the following YAML.
  For this YAML to take effect, the **mediaplayer:** configuration must include configuration
  of the **volume_increment:**. Typically 10% should be suitable but depends on the dB range defined
  by the **volume_max:** and **volume_min:** under **audio_dac:**. The % equivalent to around 6dB decrease
  should have a benficial effect, but also depend on the updateInterval frequency for checking faults.
**Note:** all binary sensors are updated at the **update interval:** defined under **audio_dac:** or
if not defined defaults to 4s. For ESP32-S3 Louder, update interval can be reduced as low as 1s.

Example configuration of Tas5805m Binary Sensors:
```
binary_sensor:
  - platform: tas5805m
    have_fault:
      name: Any Faults
      exclude: CLOCK_FAULT
    left_channel_dc_fault:
      name: Left Channel DC Fault
    right_channel_dc_fault:
      name: Right Channel DC Fault
    left_channel_over_current:
      name: Left Channel Over Current
    right_channel_over_current:
      name: Right Channel Over Current
    otp_crc_check:
      name: CRC Check Fault
    bq_write_failed:
      name: BQ Write Failure
    clock fault:
      name: I2S Clock Fault
    pcdd_over_voltage:
      name: PCDD Over Voltage
    pcdd_under_voltage:
      name: PCDD Under Voltage
    over_temp_shutdown:
      name: Over Temperature Shutdown Fault
    over_temp_warning:
      name: Over Temperature Warning
      on_press:
        - media_player.volume_down
```

## Sensor
Under the tas5805m sensor platform, one sensor under configuration heading
**faults_cleared:** can be optionally configured. This sensor counts the
number of times a fault was detected and subsequently cleared by the component.
```
sensor:
  - platform: tas5805m
    faults_cleared:
      name: "Times Faults Cleared"
```
Configuration variables:
- **update interval:** (*Optional*): The interval at which the sensor is updated.
  Defaults to 60s
